CASE 1: 
The above code is wrong because it gives garbage value as the other programmer does not give value to w, so the output comes is garbage.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Bulb
{
private:
w;
public:
void setwattage(int e)
{
if(e>0 && e<=240) w=e;
else w=0;
}
int getwattage()
{
return w;
}
};
int main()
{
Bulb g;
cout<<"Wattage is "<<getWattage()<<endl;
return 0;
}



CASE 2:
IF we assign w=0, while declaring w
i.e 
class Bulb
{
private:
int w=0;
-
-
-
};
But we can not assign the value while declaring the variable/properties in class , Therefore code won't get compilled


CASE 3:

Class Bulb
{
private:
int w:
public:
void initilize()
{
w=0;
}
--
-
-

-
-
};
But still problem will not get solved. Because it is not gurantee that the other programmer can call this funciton


CASE 4:

NOw we need a function which automatically call when we create a object of class.
The solution is constructor.
